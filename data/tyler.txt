[Spoken Word: Jerrod Carmichael]
Exactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle-






[Intro]
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me




[Verse 1]
Secrets
Oh, you spin my head around (Oh, you spin my head around)
I been lookin' for it (For it, for it)
I been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
Secrets
Keep it up
To make you love me (Ah)
Wade in your water (Wade in your water)
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'




[Chorus]
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me




[Bridge]
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty, fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?
Are you–




[Verse 2]
So
Take your mask off
I need her out the picture (Wade in your water)
Take your mask off (Yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
Don't save, don't save, don't save
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track out the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time




[Outro]
Of time, of time
Runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time
Time
Yeah






[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are




[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote




[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand






[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down (Yeah)
No, don't shoot me down (Okay)
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
We show 'em no respect




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Turn me up a little bit)




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Verse 1]
Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you're the best to me? I know you're the worst for me
Boy, you're sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
They show 'em no respect




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Look)
No, don't shoot me down




[Verse 2]
Oh, you passive-aggressive? Oh, you fakin' you're mad?
(You started with a mere hello)
Oh, you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah, I'm brushin' you off
'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite garçon
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near
(You started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round a god around this time next year




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down (Fucked up)
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why I start to think it's lame as fuck
(Well, I'm here for you)




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Bridge]
(You started with a mere hello)
You're a gun 'cause I like you on my side at all times
You keep me safe (No, don't shoot me down)
(You started with a mere hello)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (All the time)
You could be dangerous to me (Time, time)
Or anyone else




[Verse 3]
Look, they be bringin' us up
(You started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a 10
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me




[Outro]
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)




[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)




[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Breathe on a song

[Part I]




[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor




[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?




[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch




[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck




[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?




[Interlude]
Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah




[Part II]




[Intro: slowthai]
I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)




[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light




[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...




[Outro: slowthai & Jerrod Carmichael]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it






[Part I: GONE, GONE]




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)




[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone




[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me




[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life




[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)




[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul




[Part II: THANK YOU]




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again




[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Again, again
Again, again
(Got my eye)






[Verse 1]
See, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I’ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because




[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this just might be better for us, you know?




[Bridge]
('Cause I don't love like I used to)
Where did time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?




[Verse 2]
But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)




[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Al Green]
Dream
Just dream
Long ago, long ago, long ago
Dream
Just dream




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? I've got to kno–
Know
If we can still see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I can't stop you, I can't rock too
I've been back there and I can not die too
But I've got to know




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? Can we be– (Can we be friends?)
Are we still friends? Can we be friends? (Yeah)
Are we still friends?




[Instrumental Interlude]




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
I said, are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]
Don't get green skin (Green skin), keep contact (Keep contact)
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh woah




[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Can't say goodbye (Yeah, ah, ah)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (Woo)






[Instrumental]






[Verse 1: Santigold]
Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer


[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home


[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator]
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Call, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on


[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Hurry cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Yeah, leave the lights on






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
It's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot (Hot), chocolate


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Leche for my (Woo!) damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate


[Verse 2: Jerry Paper]
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime






[Verse 1]
That's a goal
Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo


[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that


[Verse 2]
That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad (Where's my gifts?)
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want (More)
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in (Boy)
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this


[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's me






[Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
When the gloves come off, I sleep
That's when the cold begins to creep (Creep in)
I can't feel my hands
Ahh


[Tyler, the Creator]
Boom, boom, ba-boom
Go down
Back to one (Two)
Yeah






[Instrumental]






[Intro]
Bitch, fuck! (Uh, uh, fuck)
You have a question?


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?
How much drive can I have until I run outta road?
How much road can they pave until I run outta land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows, and posies
Fallin' outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, then I'm TNT, I'm gone


[Bridge: Rex Orange County]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Shout out to the girls that I led on
For occasional head and always keepin' my bed warm
And tryin' their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keepin' me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be until them Black lives matter?
Niggas click-clack splatter, (Pew) pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm drivin' is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one (Nah)
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if them ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in


[Outro: Rex Orange County]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
Don't come back
Don't come back
Ayy, don't come back
Don't come back
No, no






[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga


[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it






[Tyler, The Creator]
Sometimes, I sit in my room and think about us


[Shane Powers]
"It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests... Uh, What’s uh, pick that one... What's uh... What's your name? Hello? Um, okay, well, since you want to be Mr. Fucking-Secret-Agent, what song you wanna hear?"


[Wyatt Navarro]
The one about me






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up


[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes


[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'Fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!


[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)


[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?


[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way-way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Shit


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues
Like how I ain't notice that? (How I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (Skrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
'Cause y'all throw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga


[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga


[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes
Haha






[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah


[Bridge: Estelle & Tyler, the Creator]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go


[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter






[Intro: Rex Orange County & Corinne Bailey Rae]
When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies
When you're having fun (time flies)
Out the window (it goes, goes, goes)


[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Ah


[Verse 1: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
'Cause boredom got a new best friend (oh, oh, oh)
Boredom got a new best friend
Na-na-na, na-na-na, oh-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh


[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
(Find some time, oh)


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all-day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."


[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)


[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something(Tick Tock)
(Ti-Ti-Tick Tock)
(Oh)


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator & Anna of the North]
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock
Boredom got a new best friend
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock


[Outro: Rex Orange County]
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time


[Shane Powers]
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"






[Intro: Shane Powers]
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun


[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time


[Verse 1]
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place


[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time


[Verse 2]
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow


[Bridge]
(Hey)
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock


[Verse 3]
Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick-tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)


[Verse 4]
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)


[Outro]
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Fuck, hello






[Part I: 911]


[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me) How you doin'?
(Call me) My name is Lonely, nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me, woo!


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me)
911, call me some time
(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911


[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Anna of the North]
Call me
911, call me some time
You should call me
911, call me some time
911, (you should call me, oh)
911, (you should call me)


[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...


[Part II: Mr. Lonely]


[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely


[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911


[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!






[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mula!


[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' seeds like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song "Flower"
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas, they can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
I'm droppin' seeds on these bitches for the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden, flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker, Weezy Baby the boy, yugh!






[Intro]
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...


[Chorus]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup


[Verse 1]
What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!


[Chorus]
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup


[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy, Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November


[Bridge]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
"My November is right now"


[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback


[Outro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
[beep]






[Intro]
Da na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind (How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends


[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life


[Verse 1]
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my


[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around


[Verse 2]
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (how ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me


[Bridge]
Ooooh
(Please don't save me, yeah)
How ya feel?
(Rose tinted cheeks)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?


[Outro]
We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection
Fuck






[Instrumental]






[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album "Cherry Bomb" because "Greatest Hits" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; "Who's in charge of this Golf shit?"
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick."
It's young T


[Bridge]
I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life


[Outro]
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)






[Intro: Bunny Sigler]
"Yeah!"
"You feel alright?"
"Yeah!"


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
And fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew, them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word "faggot" with "book"
And all them "books" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch
Fucking attitude switched just like a "book" when it struts
But I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple "book" bashing
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seemed off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo, it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't—wait, let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me


[Interlude: Shane Powers, Tyler, The Creator, Bunny Sigler]
"If you fuck this up... There are so many fucking kids right now, listening to this guy."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
"Get those wings flapping, motherfucker! 'Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigga, nigga on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, die or shoot a basketball
Tyler, the dark skin arrested in Austin
Cops know who I was cause their kids said the show was awesome
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
"Tyler, Tyler, I swear to—I swear to fuck! If you fucking... Do not fuck this up! You have the whole world in your fucking hands."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
How many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring the mirrors out? I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies and snaps make it obvious
That everybody on this fucking planet lacking confidence
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)
Well can somebody bring the camera out so I can film me?
T a great director, niggas' vision must be blurry
Boy, I get them epic shots like jaywalking in Missouri
Wait, how many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring my album out so I can hear one?
Pour me a drink, shit, I don't know what to think
Cause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink
Wait, how many leaders in the house?
See why nobody got they hands up? See, that's the issue






[Verse 1]
Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when? Uh
On a scale of nine to ten
You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind, uh
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up


[Break]


[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you niggas
I'm saying (I'm saying I'm dead to you niggas)
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fucking pilot, your role is to be the stewardess
I'm the fucking bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it
The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it
If anything happens, it's one door
If I see a building, motherfucker, we're done for
I'ma hit a couple of 'em up, this is parkour
Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash
(I don't wanna crash)


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator, Syd]
I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(The wind's getting high, I don't wanna crash)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly)
It's kinda weird
(The wind is getting high)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, look (Say what?)
(Oh, yeah, yeah)


[Outro]
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be with no alphabet
Dictating where to stand at
You can buy a car, you can buy many things
You can buy happiness, but you can't buy wings
You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic
To stay cloud level
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach (Fucked up)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world, but
You in first class but you feel like coach, damn
That's why I'm in first class, but I feel like coach


[Outro]
I don't wanna—






[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Fuck you running for nigga?
Aye nigga, come here nigga
Let me try that hat on
I told you come over here stupid bitch
Come over here with that weak ass hat


[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out
In the car called life take the lame route
Going nowhere fast but you think that you not
Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop
At his drop top, took another lame out
Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?
Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga
Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
And make sure that your mama cry the pain out
Now that gang is out to get you
But you stuck in the same house
Nigga never came out, wow
It's a shame how you got sucked in that life
But hey man at least you got a name now
They say you a "real nigga" cause you kill niggas
Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out
For they approval boy, you can't even hang out
That light you hit, it was the light I held
That's why you never ever see me with my chains out
I don't need to, truth they don't feed you
Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you
They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you
Better look the other way if he ever see you
And run as fast as you can, nigga


[Outro: Chaz Bundick and ScHoolboy Q]
That's the shit I be talkin' bout, though
We ain't try'na hear that shit, my nigga
Cuz, stay preachy cuz
Like nigga come on homie
I don't wanna hear that shit, preachy shit my nigga
Yeah, we all black, who give a fuck, cuz?
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Whatchu mean?






[Instrumental Intro]


[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Find your wings (You're supposed to fly)
Find your wings (Find your wings)



[Verse 1: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta



[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Find your wings (Fly)
Find your wings (Find your wings)
(My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy)


[Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low
You're a bird
You're supposed to fly away
The way you stand there
Don't let your wings go to waste (Go to waste)
The sky is your home, be free
Be free






[Intro]
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know what it mean
It means something


[Verse 1]
Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out your flowers don't smell that good?
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else nose to win
Look, I am a God, nobody prays to the sight of you
All y'all niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
I wear pink, they can see me
Nigga, you don’t create, you just repeat
Nigga, you don’t got drive, you just beep beep
Beep beep, talk shit from the backseat


[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire
I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it


[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's cherry bomb


[Verse 2]
You motherfuckers want war? Then come get it
You motherfuckers don't really want it
You motherfuckers want war and I want more
Nigga, fuck you and everything that you come for
You motherfuckers wanna blow?
Pow, pow-pow, pow-pow
Then let’s take ‘em to the gun store
I don't got enough time, fuck your Rolex, nigga
Don’t compare him to mine, ‘cause I don’t know that, nigga


[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it


[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"GOLF 191, Okaga! Playing only classic hits!"






[Verse 1]
I don't want you thinking I love you 'cause I stay
Girl I really like you and happy we got laid
I think about your windows like four times in a day
I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved
Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking
The holy grail of your body, when you be pissin'
This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen
I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa
You hoping I'm joking, but first


[Hook]
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load


[Verse 2]
Your pussy tighter than door hinges
I munch you like sandwiches
But not any more 'cause I'm on tour, so
Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hard, shit, I might need ice pack on my wrist
Fucking, I'm pumping, you know it's coming
Bust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating
I leave you slumped in the back of my truck, butt naked
Suck it out of me, I leave you with nuttin', get it?
This is what you wanted, this is what you came for


[Hook]
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load


[Interlude: Syd & Tyler]
There's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries (You blow me away)
With your cherry (Cherry Bomb)
Make me feel like 4th of July
(Can't breathe)
Cherry
You light my fireworks
There's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries (You blow me away)
With your cherry bomb


[Outro: Shane Powers]
That was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film [honk]
Be caller eight to win tickets to the triple feature at the Moon Theatres tonight
Three back to back to back movies at the Moon Theatres tonight
Be the eighth caller, only on Golf Radio
G-O-L-F, G-O-L-F, it's Golf Radio






[Chorus]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater


[Verse 1]
About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince
Tiptronic stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is AM
Might get that X6 end, don't follow exit him
Might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
No AMG, it's M, boy I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratching rims again


[Chorus]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl, I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater


[Bridge]
Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, 'cause you driving me wild
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much
And you can feel the beat in my heart
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much


[Verse 2]
I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers
And shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda
Then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonald's
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm
Cashing so many checks they're calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Probably September...
Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves
Skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
'Cause I killed the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (beep)
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it


[Verse 3]
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)


[Skit]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy!
But I love it when your hair...


[Verse 4]
Blows, when it blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches


[Interlude]
You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows
(It blows me away)
I know we'll have a good time
You just gotta stop being scared
Just roll
Just come and roll with me
It's all good


[Skit]
Yeah, man, what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man. I've been doing some push-ups and shit

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I looked in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat just like the kick and the snare
ScHoolboy's my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy not that bad, eh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, and the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We blackout, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy man
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to a Dodger
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, mind motherfuckin' been gone
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow


[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned-ed
23 with a crib, and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's that Cherry Bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals
Boy, I'm a sicko, Flaco nigga, but kinda macho
Boy, I got some vatos and shout out to ScHooly, he kinda loco
Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles
Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
(Man, he really took the store)


Crack a cracker with a barrel, uh (yeah)
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag (rag)
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy (uh, sup cuz?)
Pants heavy, sag to the left with the belt strapped
No face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still, the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried 'bout no niggas (nigga)
I don't grieve over suckers (sucker)
Gunpowder on my knuckles (knuckle)
Call the ambulances (ambulances)
I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?
Cuz is wack in his raps and what he rap, he ain't done
It's Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussyboy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kill
Well, who am I?


Part 2 - SPECIAL (Hidden track, physical only)


[Intro]
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
Anything that'll piss you muthafuckas off
I don't even smoke and I'm a level above of y'all
Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card


[Hook]
I'm special, nigga
Who the fuck are you?!
I'm special, nigga


[Verse]
They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm runnin' shit, that's why you never see me wearin' joggers
Lead by example, how?
All y'all is my son and I ain't never had a fuckin' father
Boy, I'ma bring the noise
I got my own beat and we all got drums
What these weapons about? We're just flexin' about
You on your grind but who the one that got the wep at their house?
Bitch, I do this on purpose, you niggas don't got a purpose
This nigga call me a clown, nigga I own the circus
Stack is sittin' in my pocket folded like a papaya
You know I golf bitch like I been sleepin' with Tiger
Woody woody, my mob, mob is goodie we Oddkast
We O-K-K-K just like the clan hoodie
Golf shit packet, rip it out the fuckin' package
In that all pink fit lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even know
I gotta to tear the shit out of this goddamn house
I think that I'mma blow my muthafuckin' brains out
Tyler, take a chill pill, nigga






Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG


[Intro]
Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion begin
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't


[Pre-Chorus]
There go the policeman (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love


[Verse 1]
A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)


[Pre-Chorus]
There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love


[Verse 2]
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck


[Outro]
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young


Part 2 - PERFECT


[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)


[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah


[Outro]
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I bloom)
I rock (I glow)






Part I


[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga


[Pre-Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important
I'm focused (Two, three, four)
Bring in the horns


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, God damn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nig​ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
Well, when we ate, it was the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!


[Bridge: Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me? (Two, three, four)
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas (Two, three, four)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' (Two, three, four)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?" Yeah, my nigga
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, "Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrrrt)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room, damn
(Two, three, four)


Part II


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it

Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah (Yeah)
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear

But its the two-thou' and the one-four and the one-five
Yo, what up Wayne?

Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (Yeah), that's a dream car

That's that one-nine-nine-one
'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause nigga I'm a god, a divine one; Tune!
My trigger finger wise but my 9 dumb (Yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rolie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy, let's get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot (Uhh..)
Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini, I know
It ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange
Nah faggot, it's Golf Wang
(Two, three, four)






[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's, nigga keep the O's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the O's, (nigga) keep the O's
Know they know me by "Treat Your Nose"


[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Look, UFO, bow, land
Skrr landed on the ass and
Adidas leaf in the grassland
My finger got a yellow Pac-Man
Blow your purple, go in circles, so inertia
Go reverse it, no rehearsin', gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion, golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving
Yeah you heard me


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's, nigga keep the O's

Keep the O's, (nigga) keep the O's
Know they know me by "Treat Your Nose"


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Your garden is full from raking these hoes
A handful of green and a couple of stones
Your lawn mower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise
I know my accomplishments
Fuck all yo compliments
Bitch, I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck
I do not have to adjust to stunt
Don't talk don't jump don't cheer just shut the fuck up
You're speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You beaming and circle in Bimmers you hoping them niggas’ll see it
Results may vary, my chain, it's not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than to crash in that Bugatti
But back to the garden, Niggas gone do you dirty
Already started, killing your flowers
It seems impossible, it's the new slave apocalypse, so sad and obvious that
All y'all stupid niggas got the whips and no drive


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's (Keep the O's)
Cause you never know when it's over
You want the doors that go up
You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time
Find your wings
Find your wings
Find your wings
And fly
Cause you'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly (learn)
Let me tell you what I want you to do
What I want you to do
You'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly
(Learn)
Keep the O's


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now
What the fuck has gotten into me, man






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Let's just run away from here ('cause it's not, 'cause it's not)
Working out on Earth, my dear ('cause It's not, 'cause it's not)
What you really want, girl (ooh)
My heart stops pumping blood when I see you (I see you when I see you)
But I try to play it cool because (I like you, I really like you)


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you're so special
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me...


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Let's move to California
Right now (pack your bags, go pack your bags)
I have wings on my back, so we don't (take the plane, have to take the plane)
Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes
(Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified)
Oh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care
(When you rub my hands switching fifth gear)
Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)
'Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (we're gonna go flyin' to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, did you pack your bags)
Leave your crew, bring your coat, 'cause it’s cold (leave your crew, bring your coat)


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you're so special
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me (oh)


[Verse 3: Alice Smith (Leon Ware)]
(Don't you wanna go girl)
(Let's go, let's go)
(Right now)
I think I believe you (Let me show you how girl)
It's nice that I need to
The earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff
What, what, what (She would love that)
I think I believe you
Take me higher
Let's make our way over
To the Okaga cave
Today (today)
There we will stay, play it cool now
X-Y-Z how?
Welcome me in
Then we'll begin


[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Suckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair
Fast .wind, slow wind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy, oh
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Laying on my arm, it's dead
From the pressure of your head
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, but you meant it
Like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sipping on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
'Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all
Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah


[Coda: Leon Ware]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
(Wait)
Oh yeah (Let's go!)
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
(Watch this) Let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah
(Favorite director)
(Gonna be good)
Come on, baby
What you wanna do?
(I’m happy you came)
(I really like you)


[Outro: Alice Smith (Leon Ware)]
Take me away
Fuck what they say
To another place
Another day
We in outer space
We'll waste our days
Sade, Sade, Sade (sade)
Oh, right now (fuck what they say)
Yes!
Let's go to the moon (Yes!)
(Alright alright let me do it, hold up, shhh)
(It's about to start)






[Verse]
Now when I first saw you
I could tell you was the one
That I've been searchin' for
I needed somethin' that was like the Sun
Now all my flowers grow
Right now my life, it blooms, baby
You're my favorite color, my favorite color
My favorite color's you
It's like the endless summer, endless summer
It never ends with you
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow






[Intro]
You are a whore, you are a whore (Fuck)
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
'Cause I think you’re a fucking fag


[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
"Sam, the music sounds good, man! You've been practicing?"
"Thanks"
"Sam, this is Wolf. He's new here."
"What's up, dude?"
"Wolf, this is Sam. Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while. Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright? Now you guys have fun"
"So, you guys are into jazz?"
"Look. Wolf, Prairie Dog, Ronzell—whatever the fuck your name is. We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright? You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours, capisce?"






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Pop ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" (nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!


[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flock around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit


[Outro: Domo Genesis]
C'mon, my nigga! You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as f- you’re butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel






[Verse 1]
Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause


[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy


[Verse 2]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay


[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy


[Verse 3]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then


[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
"Hey..."
"Bitch."
"I'm right here."
"Yo, who's that..?"
"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?"


[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy






[Verse 1]
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face


[Hook]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag


[Verse 2]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I’m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl


[Hook]
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag


[Verse 3]
You got a nigga... Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven’t talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password
So I’m always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung


[Outro]
You're my girlfriend... You're my girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl... You're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend (You know I like you a lot!)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you not)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriend






[Intro]
Swag, 2011
Young Nigga


[Verse 1]
Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco


[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang


[Verse 2]
So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be


[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang


[Verse 3]
Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure


[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang


Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang


[Outro]
Cut it out!
I said I didn’t want no goddamn lettuce
I don’t want that shit
I don’t want your goddamn lettuce [laughter]






[Chorus 1: Tyler, The Creator]
(Can we talk on the phone or something)
Because when I call (When I call you on the phone)
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
"Dad" isn't your name, see "Faggot"'s a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You a fucking faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him...
I hope he answer


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you
(I hope you answer)


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgic
I'll call her number
But she won't answer


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a Church's
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
The last verse was about this girl, haha






[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun (what?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
OK, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics ("How's your dick?") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?) Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy, listening to "Cowboy", ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this OF
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (what?) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords
Making up shit, pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Frank Ocean & Both]
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars (handle bars)
Hair blowing in the wind (ooohh)
Her freckles look like candy bars (shit)
My cool summer never ends (cool)
My bitch is on my handle bars
Yeah (bars, bars)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater


[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Oh my God, seriously? Mister cool guy, haha
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser
Hehe, oh fuck






[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from


[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn’t realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I’m fine
I got a little money in my pocket


[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soul, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry


[Outro: Nas & Tyler, The Creator]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)
Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever
Next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?






[Verse]
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"






[Part 1 | PartyIsntOver]


[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me


[Part 2 | Campfire]


[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting


[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer


[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation, ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart


[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really


[Part 3 | Bimmer]


[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash


[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah




[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash


[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow


[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer


[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight


[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Tyler, The Creator)]
C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (Look)
(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Wolf and Salem]
"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"






[Verse 1]
Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care


[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga


[Verse 2]
Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... "uh" with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind
Umm "Who are you again?" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'mma [fuck] her and toss her in the principal's office
(Tyler, I'll go with you)
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? (Where are my parents at?-) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again


[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga


[Bridge]
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum
Bum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours


[Verse 3]
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make ‘em dip
I'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them's being happy






[Intro]
I don't fucking like this shit, fuck
Ah!


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger (Uhh)
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend
Like I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers (Uhm)
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs., I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (Uhh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch


[Hook: Casey Veggies & (Tyler, the Creator)]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Yeah
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man
(Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot) Ah man
(Yeah) Yeah


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...) I had a decline in the buzz
Not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask Bob bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthony
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem


[Verse 3: Mike G]
I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals, bitch


[Hook]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Yeah)
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Ah man)
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot (Ah man)
(Yeah) Yeah


[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup
(I thought that you were nice) Yeah I am, slut
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas, yep, I'm a mixed mutt
'Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case
Golf is the bed sheets (Hat and my T-shirt)
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen
It's Bimmer Boy's, boy; never swerving in the Benz
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?


[Outro]
It's Loiter Squad nigga...
Fucking Loiter Squad...
(That shit was fucking crazy)
Yeah
(Damn)


[Skit]
Yo, Wolf, nigga
What? Why are you running?
Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem been hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me?
You got a booger in your nose
What the, wait, slow down, wait, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him fir-






[Intro: Jason Dill]
"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"


[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing


[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch


[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine


[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator (as Sam)]
Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?






[Intro: Na'kel, Tyler, The Creator, Lee Spielman]
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes--
Hold on, hold on, hold on, run that shit back!
(This is a DJ Stankdaddy exclusive!)
I want the black kids to like me for this one, man
Trashwang! Woah!
Illegal CIV!

[Verse 1: Na'kel]
Bitch, I'm with the fucking extras
Big dog, cup full of egg nog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes
They just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow
Pusha Georgia trip, bitch I got it poppin'
Me and Jasper going coffin shopping
Nose of the board see a lotta boxes
Bitches see the boy and they mouth be frothing
Chain is glossing
Bitch


[Hook: Left Brain]
Trash Wang niggas

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, yeah, them niggas is swell
Tighter than a straight nigga going to jail
Locked in a box, nigga, off them socks
I can finally afford the bail
My bitch isn't bad
She's pretty normal looking with a real nice ass
Now hop off my dick, what it be
Bitch, Mob, Task, Force, Lil, B, nigga
Speaking of the devil
Y'all niggas cornier than kettle
Y'all couldn't smoke crack or heroin
In a Black Ops plane and reach my level
Ate some bugs and I made some carats
Fuck y'all niggas' bullshit, y'all cherish
I'm 21, I threw a party but…
Difference is, y'all didn't have a Ferris
Wheel


[Verse 3: Jasper Dolphin]
55 grams in that blunt, nigga
I face that
Just copped that motherfucker bimmer nigga

Get chipped like that nigga from Stomp The Yard
Don't fuck with Jasper
He a retard
Kill your motherfucking grandma and have your family scarred


[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Might fuck around and be a goat named Felicia
Sorry, got a little excited
It's probably all the meth Walt Jr. provided
Wolf Gang up in this bitch
Red Riding Hood is pissed
Somebody tell Megan and Sara to come and suck a-

Don't let them skateboards fool you

[Verse 6: Lucas Vercetti]
Holding up my chain

[Salem]
You wanna hear the new song we just did? It's not finished but... yeah


[Intro: Coco O]
I wanna go
I wanna go
Baby, let's go
To my treehome (To my treehome)
Treehome


[Verse 1: Erykah Badu & Tyler, the Creator]
Special
So let's go
Let's go oh-oh
Oh, let's go
I wanna go
Mmm
Treehome
Bridge!


[Bridge 1: Coco O & Tyler, the Creator]
Colorful you are
Yeah, that won't stop
You're my favorite crayon in the box
Let's think outside the lines
Come to my treehouse, yeah let’s escape
Then let me go, headfirst in your lake
From what I heard, it's great
It's great
There's a party


[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Tyler]
Tuesday is good news day Woo!
Not usually a full tray Yeah
Can you pack your PJs?
There's a party
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be special
I'm special, baby
No one ever comes here
Yeah


[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a food tray
Boy, you must be special
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be (Let's go to my treehouse baby)
Let's just escape
Let's go to my treehouse baby
Special
Let's just escape
You and me
Oh, he's special
Let's just escape
Will you come into my treehouse?






[Intro: Tallulah]
Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn ni**er
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned (I'm just fucking around)


[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"


[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos


[Hook 2: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a (squeaky) sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kelly Clancy]
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!






[Intro: Dr. TC]
So, what's going on, Wolf? Talk to me, man. People worry. We hearing stories about you getting into fights and all this unnecessary bullshit. It's—Wh—What's on your mind? Talk to me, I'm here


[Hook]
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (Wolf Gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds (Paid)
Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again (Nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)
Too soon (Yeah)


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ugh, my nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga, Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Your boy seem happy as fuck, but truthfully, your boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target
Without bothering customers bothering
Asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Naww, nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God, I wanna quit ... But I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Life's a bitch, bruh, but from the third floor, man, she's gorgeous
A year ago I was broke; now, how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables; now, I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now, the frame is a pain in the ass
To get it in without a scratch or stain on the glass
But that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
But when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy, you bitch
Shit, I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-a-ture
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture


[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (Wolf Gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds (Paid)
Mama got the Rover with the Range (Yeah)
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again (Nigga)
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (Rest in peace)
Too soon (Yeah)


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Grandmother died, didn't cry, not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird, no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup, it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped
She was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she crying, saying, "Sadie is dying"
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, 'cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck! Nah, this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death, and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital, I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there
There's her room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, "Hello"
Our conversation's brief
Couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her, you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days, bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there, 20 minutes tops
Hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night


[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, that's heavy, man. I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah, whatever. Don't worry about it...
The last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you
Fuck that nigga, Samuel!
Uhh, have you seen him?
Nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed him.






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on


[Verse 1]
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?


[Interlude: Tyler The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied"
"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"I try too hard, huh?"
"No, you don't"


[Verse 2]
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make "Parade" or "Inglorious"
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?"
"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that."
"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now."
"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at home?"
"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?"
"I have, I mean you're a great person."
"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?"


[Verse 3]
People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"I'm not homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the last time we..."
"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can."
"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD."
"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't."
"I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"I wish Thebe was here."


[Verse 4]
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men—I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, alright, uh, so you was telling me you went to New York…






[Intro]
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah


[Verse 1]
I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'


[Chorus]
Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang


[Verse 2]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn


[Chorus]
Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah


[Verse 3]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead






[Intro]
Random disclaimer!
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one


[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like? Saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring


[Pre-Chorus]
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing


[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

Odd Future, Wolf Gang
We came together cause
We ain't have nobody else
Do you?
You just might be one of us
Are you?


[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rockstar
Rebel and defiance makes my motherfucking cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up? Fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fucking money (hey mom)
I ain't got no motherfucking daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything


[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing


[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

[Post-Chorus 2]

They want us to go to they schools and
Be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit
Fuck that

'Cause at the end

[Chorus]
Fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

Odd Future, nigga
Stand the fuck up!
I'm not saying just to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes
What I'm trying to tell you is
Do what the fuck you want
Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want
I'm a fucking unicorn
And fuck anybody, who say I'm not
Wolf Gang

Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions

See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go...


[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta let these shits go, man. It's not making sense to you right now, but... all these little dreams you got, they're not shit. All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit... getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. You gotta look at reality, understand that shit, so you don't get caught. I'm just being real
Nigga, fuck you
I'm just trying to help you, man, trust me
Look, I mature day after day, nigga, you don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Whatever






[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude


[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
He's at your window


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous






[Intro]
Left Brain, Wolf Haley
Golf Wang, Free Earl, uh


[Verse 1]
Goddamn I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don’t shine
Bitch don’t mind me, shake your hiney
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You’re a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Miss Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what’s that? The cock of a black dude
Mad cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum (aww, fuck it)
I’ll take her to the back room dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that’s not from the time signature of the month, umm


[Hook]
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick


[Verse 2]
Goddamn I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes
Cook and clean and grant my wishes
And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwiches
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that’ll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!)
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I’m allergic
(I like your cape) Oh this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can’t eat pussy cause I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle?
I don’t want a bride, I just want bone marrow


[Hook]
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick


[Outro]
Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It’s a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain’t acting right
It’s because I’m Dracula bitch, (swag, swag, swag)
It's because; Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang…






[Intro: Dr. TC]
So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off...


[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead


[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems


[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF


[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems


[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?


[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa)
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back


[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems


[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me


[Outro]
(Calm down, man)
Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)
Tron Cat






[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
AAAAHHH!


[Verse]
Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga’s sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic


[Outro: Dr. TC]
What the fuck?
I... I'm speechless, that was... fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a... fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?






[Intro]
Oh I don't need the metronome bro
Ayy
When you wanna be, ahh
When you eat all the cheese in the store
In the the store, in the store, in the store, yeah, yeah yeah
Alright


[Verse 1]
(It's this girl)
She lives next door, to the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
(It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images, her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook
(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (Arrrrgh!)
(It's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
(It's this girl)
Her name is my password, fuck
(This girl)


[Verse 2]
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
And she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands walking home
I look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate, but
(This girl)
Things are looking great, cut copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
(Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's; she's not alone (Fuck)
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? (Shit)
Come to find out she got back with her nigga


[Interlude]
(Damn!)
Fuck
(It's this girl)
Another one
It's not the first time




[Verse 3]
(It's this girl)
She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
(Girl)


[Verse 4]
My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such and such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked ("Yeah, I fucked!")
Or I could tell him the truth and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie and say she moved to Nebraska


[Outro]
(It's this girl)
But she's not mine






[Intro: Tyler]
Odd Future
Wolf Gang
They are them
We are us
Kill them all (Do it with me)
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, bitch, bitch over there in the yellow, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Say it loud!
Like you mean it!
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang


[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh


[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them


[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr


[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them


[Verse 3: Hodgy]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank


[Tyler]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch


[Outro]
And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf Gang






[Part 1: Fish]


[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go


[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)
(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)
(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)


[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating


[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh


[Bridge: Frank Ocean & (Tyler, The Creator)]
(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)


[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish


[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]


[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'


[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores


[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'


[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with


[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')


[Chorus]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)
Bitch (She a boppin' bitch)
She a boppin' bitch


[Outro]
Where's my gun? (She boppin') I'ma kill this bitch
Why am I gon' kill this bitch?
To all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch (She's boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt






[Hook: Tyler]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you can bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me


[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in, when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake


[Hook: Tyler]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we could eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me


[Verse 2: Tyler]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine


[Bridge: Tyler]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (Look)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (Let's go to sleep)
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep






[Intro: Jasper Dolphin]
Oh, shit (Swag)
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future doin' some crazy shit (Bitch)
By the way, we do punch bitches, huh


[Verse 1: Jasper Dolphin]
I'm a swagging, bitch (Swag), I'm iced out (Iced out)
Oh, you mad, bitch? (Bitch) 'Cause I'm laying on the couch (Woo)
Smoke a blunt, fuck a bitch in the butt, I'm bossing (Bow, bow)
Don't give a fuck, I never roll Slauson

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Got the bops in the house, socking bitches in they mouth (Bitch)
See my neck? Iced the fuck out (I'm getting money, nigga)
She at the fucking mall, forty bitches on my nutsack
I pulled up on a mothafuckin' unicorn (I'm getting ponies, nigga)
Wolf Gang, nigga
Scream that 'til they motherfucking show me death
Golf Wang, nigga
Free Earl, better show some motherfucking respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head, make your bitch massage my shoulders


[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow, bow)
My bitch suck dick like (What) she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow)


[Verse 3: Travis Taco]
Shut up, bitch (Shut up, bitch), suck my dick (Suck my nuts)
You fucking bop (Bitch), you better swallow it
I got a chain with a fuckin' platinum plaque on it
Is that a hundred dollar bill? I'll shit on it
I bought a fucking whale, 'cause I'm ballin' (Ow)
Your bitch work for me, she my dick washer
Swag on my dick, 30 thousand million, nigga


[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Goddamn)


[Verse 4: Jasper Dolphin]
You bopping, bitch, (Question mark) you like this dick?
We all know why, 'cause you's a boppin' bitch (Bow, bow, bow)
I got the burner, I pop you in your lip (Bow, bow)
Zoom-zoom, yeah, I'm going fast, bitch
I'm loud as fuck (I'm loud as fuck), I'm ignorant (Ignorant)
Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurking, bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again, I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy, bitch, don't look at my wrist (At my wrist)
Because if you do (If you do), I might blind you bitch (Bitch)
Mount Everest ain't fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this the Ice Age, bitch (Bitch suck dick)


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin, Tyler, the Creator, Jasper Dolphin]
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch

Yo, yo, Jasper, Taco, y'all my niggas, man
I love y'all niggas, I'm sorry
[Gunshot]
Ow! What the fuck?!






[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you


[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world


[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's where I'm at
Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?


[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world


[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?


[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
Can we get backstage, man? No, faggot, it's sold out
Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots
But I'm a fucking unicorn Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
Here’s some give a fuck cake Oh, maybe I should have some
Asshole, have none
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building


[Gunshots]






[Instrumental]






[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, you... obviously have some fucking problems
And, this—, this is... this is the end of this session, let's... anything else you've gotta say?


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more
Than I see her before I go on tour and it hurts (Yeah)
I miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
As you should, that shit's outrageous
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my muhfuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck
I'm here to talk to you
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Who, Travis?
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend


[Interlude 1: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You have everyone around you
You have thirty meetings a day
I don't see what it is
I mean, you—you act like you don't have anyone to talk to
I'm here for you, I'm your friend
When I say "Odd," y'all say "Future!"
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck
Fuck!
You're doin' good, you have a cult following
You're—"Yonkers"...
Tch—To these white kids?
Oh, my gosh


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi, but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a La-ti
So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic, fucking orphan
Oops! I mean, bastard, skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard (Yeah?)
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher


[Interlude 2: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
All right, just calm down
That ain’t shit, man
Now, don’t—don’t—don’t make yourself feel guilty
That—that article was great...
No, fuck that, nigga
You're beating yourself up and you're living the fucking life right now, kid!
When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now
Fuck that, fuck all this shit!
You—You—You act like I’m not here
You're not!
I'm exactly who you’re supposed to be talking to
You don’t fucking help me with shit!
You don’t help me with shit! Fuck!
Yeah, you get... that—that—who wouldn’t do that?
Fuck you! Fuck, you!
Who wouldn’t—who wouldn't shoot their friend?
Old fucking fuck!
That’s fine, it’s not your fault
I killed my fucking friends! Fuck!
(We're gonna need security in here, and, uh…)
Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!
(Gonna need something to calm him down)
I'm—I'm not fucking crazy—I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!
(Yes, come quick, he’s losing it)
No, fuck this shit!
Tyler, calm down!


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Dr. TC]
I'ma grab the Nina (No!) and find a nice arena
'Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina
Get security in here
And I’m not even human, I’m a body-shaped demon
With some semen in my sack, and some problems in the back
Calm the fuck down!
And a life that’s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one (No!) like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse
And the parents of the one that’s getting married has a curse
And it’s made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait, it gets worse!
All the guests that’s in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler...)
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse You don't want to do this...
So they tied the knot
Now it’s too late to reverse this arrangement
Yes, it is!
And the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and
Calm the fuck down!
But it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
Now, a bunch of whispering immerse...


[Outro: Dr. TC, Tyler, The Creator, Security Guard & Nurse]
Yeah, he's right there, security's right there
Shit! No! Get away from me! (Get him)
And then the nurse blurts... (Come here)
What the fuck is his problem?
Here, we have two doses to give him, here
Why didn’t anybody ask him first?
(Get on the ground!)
Hold him down
I’ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler
Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!
(Come here, motherfucker!)
Because nobody gave a fuck
Get the fuck off of me...
Someone gave a fuck, Tyler, and, uh...
The person that gave a fuck was me
See, you’re not going crazy...
It’s me
I’m your best friend, Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends? They’re just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC... See, Tyler, I’m your conscience
I’m Tron Cat...
I’m Ace...
I’m Wolf Haley...
I’m...
Me






[Intro]
Uh, Jesus, heheh


[Verse 1]
Nigga this is my cup
Drink the cyanide up
Dope as fuck
So I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it)
Put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference
Just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple Rots
In the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle
Eatin' toaster strudel
At a nude beach in Rome
In a black Bape spaghetti strap made of Ramen noodles
My bitch is bad
Mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky
This will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class
I rather be happy than fucking forty
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope– (They didn't like it)
Oh well
Let's get XXL to write us a fucking story


[Hook: Hodgy]
It's sitting right in my lap, I see it
Scribbled across the lines, I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast nigga


[Verse 2]
Fucking aw, get you some
Obviously intended pun
Same time it took Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom made, one of one
Sold out Roxy performance
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches
Started back in fucking London
Cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch of fucking faces
(Stomp 'em out)
Moshing pits to breaking arms
Zombie Circus not a carn–
Evil wolves is on the farm
And were all evil harmed
Any sheep creep
Quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep
Fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek
God
Bastard was the shit, explains why it never leaked
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)
Oh, that's the black talking in me
Let me down a couple cups of bleach


[Hook: Hodgy]
It's sitting right in my lap, I see it
Scribbled across the lines, I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast nigga


[Verse 3]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree lick a couple pimple covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dykes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dykes that fight niggas
Alright
Enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake's house and play Goblin in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six, then
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures, and
Post 'em on my Twitter, then
Go to Jimmy Fallon, like "Faggot, when we perfomin'?"
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin'
On the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get ya tanks before this wolf war's over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier






[Instrumental]






[Verse]
Rollin' in a golden Tacoma, the shit's stolen
If that bitch tell on me, I'ma do a fuckin' drive-by in her colon with my meat
Gotta keep it obsolete like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat
Fuck Jeeves ask me for advice, if I'm not reading a Vice
I'm squatting down, picking cracker bitches scalp for some lice
Everything that I write is dope because the pipe
And nope you can't have a hit unless you gimme the light
We be burning Dutty Rocks with a light switch
Bitch nigga, you about as hard as a dike's clit
I'm going as hard as Bishop Eddie Long's John
After I bought a Sidekick and sent that fag some nice pics
They say I try too goddamn hard
No shit, I want a Grammy you damn retard
You can't be great when you settle for a flea bargain
Unless you're a thrift hipster bitch in a leotard
Painless
Hodgy lost his motherfucking mind because the brain left
Wolf Gang got the ink on me now it's banged out
Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out
Congress
I guess I'm fuckin' with the best blondes
Um yes, I am now beating off to mom sex
Raquel is wrestling a prom dress
While me and Ray Charles have a fucking staring contest
To all the stepdads in here
Trip-six kids got you motherfucks scared
It could be worse, nigga that's absurd
Nigga I am at Pharrell's tryna butt fuck nerds
This just in, Tyler the Creator and Justin Bieber
Was just in the room flippin' Selena Gomez
Go 'head, give some, pucker up
I'll fuck her up until the kids come in, umm
After Tron Cat I got the rat shook
And I ain't even have a hook
For the white kids to sing along
I don't wanna sing a song, fuck that
Now cyberbully sissies on my little sisters Macbook
I got you niggas nervous like a Pop
Tryna ask his virgin, hot, vegan daughter where the cock goes
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Roscoe's
Head back to the studio to munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' and
Now I'm coming quicker than
The shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around
So Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Beat on my Johnson 'til my cock swole
Stop saying you're sick, shit is kinda old
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma, you're a common cold
Have you heard my brother verse on Llama?
When that nigga's home
Me, him and Hodgy gonna take the game and
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body
In a chokehold
Uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' minus all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black, well
Malcolm X would be proud, this white bitch getting black-maled
Blue-eyed cracker named Jenny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fucking pennies at him
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth ruth got some dick off my swole cock
'Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old box
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on
Probably 'cause I'm going harder than erect cock dick filled with Botox
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip, break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
'Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck that's left here
That's my ex bitch
Her? She's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass
It's gonna be mid-stage Coachella
Shake's faggot ass keep hatin'
But I work hard for the shit that I got
So it's still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth
All associates can suck cock






[Intro]
Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album


[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower


[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son


[Verse 2]
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them


[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this


[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school


[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep


[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church


[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys


[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it


[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating


[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail


[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?






[Verse]
I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxing, I'm taxing
"Fuck 'em all!"'s what I'm chanting, don't complain, I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, hotter than Saki Takei
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers, I'm backwards
Like Jermaine Dupri in '93, escaping from concentration camps
With a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight
Shout out to Hype Trak, them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies
Yo, yo
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk (uh!)
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished
I'm managed, hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot (fucking bastard)


[Outro]
Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didn’t mean to offend anyone
Alright, I'm lying

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Uh, yeah, how you doin' today?
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Ace the Creator, man, look
Casey Veggies, uh-huh, Odd Future, look


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch I'm dope but my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
Nigga, fuck your role model, bitch, I'm my own idol and
If you can't face it, my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorized accessories bring out my assets
Nigga they sound on acid, tablets
Stussy’s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat banging the tom-toms
My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the underdog, thrown them on the back bender
Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me
With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh-huh, yea, Ace the Creator, man
Uh, Casey Veggies, yo
Uh-huh, Odd Future, nigga
Get used to, uh, let me-
Ay, I'mma slow it down, right quick for you


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm so dapper man, funky fresh Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On award tour, on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets
I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the t-shirt is Supreme


[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
And they see me they play Pictionary
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary my name is by "Fresh"
They at the same spot they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Eargasms they have them
The hotels we staying in twelve star
Tyler said, "yo Casey, just write a twelve bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh no
Red and white diamonds, Supreme box logo






[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Got all the black bitches mad 'cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome, I always X 'em
Like Wolverine's stepson, attacking a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass
Haha, yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three-bear house eating their motherfucking porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy, special effect, the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set
With Canons hanging from our necks like it's a motherfucking circus


[Hook: Hodgy & Tyler, the Creator]
You little niggas better (Check my French)
You getting money? Better (Check my French)
What time is it, huh? (Check my French)
If you got my shit, you better check my French (Motherfucker!)
I'm making moves (Check my French)
I speak English, but (Check my French)
Your ho be on my penis, she (Check my French)
Bitch


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
'Cause every girl I'm digging
When I'm digging in her pussy I'm never using (A rubber)
But fuck it, I guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers
Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp (Hahahaha)
Yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho
The most that they can do is fine me, I'm hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
"Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no"
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go


[Hook: Hodgy & Tyler, the Creator]
You little niggas better (Check my French)
You getting money? Better (Check my French)
What time is it, huh? (Check my French)
If you got my shit you better check my French (Motherfucker!)
I'm making moves (Check my French)
I speak English, but (Check my French)
Your ho be on my penis, she (Check my French)
Bitch


[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all stars and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in their music and create the face
Of the picture, punchline, figured out, "Ahh, I get you"
No, you don't, nigga, so why don't you go and figure?
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump, and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms, and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo, you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
These Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows
We think sorta odd, so we think so


[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Crusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go 'head, admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco, you're probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watching Zorro
You homos


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & Dr. TC]
O.F.
Yes
So, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or...
No, I'm just playing the field, just for now
Ah, so... I'm guessing she's white, since she's "vanilla"
Haha






[Verse 1]
If this was a game, I already know that I would come out winner
And I'm not bragging, I'ma be in her
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like Splinter
Juicy and hot, such a black bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
But I don't give a fuck and or even list her like Schindler
She's cute but her forehead's big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco
That O.J. killed the white whores with
A wealthy white girl without the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet
Leave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that
I'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist


[Chorus]
Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
'Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow


[Verse 2]
If this was a game, I would be considered a mothafuckin' legend
And I ain't trying to gas you like Chevron
But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage
Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of (uhh)
Trying to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta' luck so now
It's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit
You're very attractive
And notice that my hat is always the color of cactus
And I hang with wolves 'cause I'm an evil bastard
Pictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered
Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch
If you wanted a date, don't come
Now you gotta make it easy for you don't run
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum
And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun
Wait, now it's about eight something
It's late and you stuck down in my base one
Come downstairs with nothing but a shoe string
Yeah bitch this date's done


[Chorus]
Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic 'cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
'Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow


[Outro]
I like my girls how I like my drugs, white
Lord, you're so pretty, lying in my arms
I just got one request, stop breathing






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayy, ayy, uh


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I was taught to act my shoe size, never my age
I always judge a book by the cover, never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
That he felt when he dealt with the physiological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes


[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit, that's from


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator & Domo Genesis]
And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight)
It's all night (Don't go home tonight, chill)
It's all night (Please stay, don't go home tonight)
And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight)
It's all night (Don't go home tonight, chill)
It's all night (Please stay, don't go home tonight)


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger
My self esteem was like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall
Shit, I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves
But I wear mine on my head, Supreme






[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)


[Verse 1]
Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without Abel
I can make music that makes sense, but not mentally stable
Eighteen with the whole world in front of me
Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we


[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)


[Verse 2]
I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk
I skip to places, smiling faces, while you fucking walk
My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that Twilight shit
You have highlights about yo life, I have life 'bout my highlights, bitch
Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid
Watch them grow and then you die? No, nigga, fuck the system


[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)


[Verse 3]
Good kids make bad grown ups, stay gold, stray old
Maturing means that your life sucks, in my wolf suit
I roam where the wild things at, still growing
Still learnin, not knowing that I'm maxed
I don't want to grow up, I know that shit for a fact
Nigga, eighteen


[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)


[Verse 4]
They say I'm immature, I say that they depressed
I talk to unicorns, I'm wearing a uniform
Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time
You live your life all serious while I'm enjoying mine


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & *Dr. TC*]
*Wow, that's, that's a really good way to look at it*
Yeah I mean... I don't. I mean I'm really hyper and everything with my imagination
*Ohh okay - ADHD?*
I'm not having ADHD like, one second I'm real hype as fuck, but the next minute - I can just slow that shit down

Hodgy Beats (Drop it)


[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
We come through throbbing like thunder storms
Make their feets get wet and funky up in they under arms
I'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwing bombs
With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on
Niggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms
Suck a dick, eat salaam getting they nails done in salons
Hodgy Beats is like lip balm
If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms
Haters must be starving nowadays, I make California Vietnam
And I'm going to embalm my creativity
Into a CD-ROM, so you can feel this shit I'm on


[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Bring the keys, yeah!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow bitches (Bring the keys, oh my God!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Could you bring the keys? Yeah!)
Slow it down, slow it down (Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?)
Slow it down (Drop the drums)


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Pink chinchilla, something like Thriller
My t-shirts are bathing, a bathing gorilla
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda
But I ate the whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eating donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Making shit come like I'm Go-Go Gadget
I'm mental, it's instrumental
Make your bitches' therapist ask for dental records
And I hope this record have you stabbing niggas with colored pencils


[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Bring the keys, yeah!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow bitches (Bring the keys, oh my God!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Could you bring the keys? Yeah!)
Slow it down, slow it down (Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?)
Slow it down (Drop the drums)


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces
You fail at life, I'll mug your teachers
I've got Muslims calling on Jesus
I fucked Kelly, where is Regis?
Found Alicia, now she keyless
Cold as ice, and now I'm creamless
Murdered every bod from my squad
So technically, now I'm teamless
O.F. is so prestigious, yeah


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, it's not that hard but
Well, for me it's not
OFM, bangin' on your FM
Ace, The Creator
Hodgy Beats
OF, yes






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carri—


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
"Augh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop!"
"Why did you do that?"
"Say sorry, say sorry!"
"Sorry! I'm sorry as fuck!
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry as fuck, ow, ow!"
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry! Don't look at this!"
"Say sorry"
"Don't look at this, ow stop!"
"Say sorry!"
"Ow! Stop 'fore you fuck something up!"
"Say, "Sorry!"
"Say, "Sor-"
"Sorry, sorry—Uncle!"
"I fucked this nigga eye up man haha"


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Häagen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fucking skate, take off that box logo






Part 1 - VCR


[Verse 1]
I don't want to play you
I just want to tape you undressing
And I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore
If it's horror, pop the popcorn
The thoughts to rape you really turns me on


[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch

You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die hard fan can't stop with the tapings
Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings
Of the VHS, especially during sex baby


[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch


[Verse 3]
Ready to watch? Imma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch


[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press this
Stop!


Part 2 - Wheels


[Verse 1]
Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key


[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um


[Verse 2]
We can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room
I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts


[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um


[Verse 3]
We can count the stars on the hood of your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take him any day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss?


[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um


[Verse 4]
We both teenagers with the same mind state
How about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waiting for that raw fish I can't wait
Get it?


[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um






[Intro]
I can't read!
I got 5
I got five on it too my nigga
You smokin my nigga?
Nah I ain't smokin
Nigga come on just hit the fucking blunt
Nah I'm not gon smoke man
This nigga never wanna smoke
I'm high off life nigga (Hot boxes be nice?)
Straight edge ass




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat
Pro-abortion, anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting "You're a jerk"
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
A lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle, let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you


[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa


[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
'Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN
BrandUn DeShay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever


[Alternate Verse 3: Mike G]
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that they call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly






[Verse 1]
I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello (Hi)
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)
Fuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one


[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss


[Bridge]
Maybe? (No)
Maybe? (I'm sorry)
Maybe? (I got a date)
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)


[Verse 2]
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went


- Tyler, what are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm..
- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head


But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah


[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss


[Verse 3]
Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?






[Intro]
They don't paint pictures, they just trace me


[Verse 1]
Odd Future, I'm your mothafucking sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price
No barging, nigga that's a bargain
Cow print t-shirt like mothafucking dog
On the mothafucking farm with cockadoodle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, Baby Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?
(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me)


[Hook]
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
No hook, fuck a hook


[Verse 2]
Yo, beside me, nobody likes me
Mainly because I am not a fucking HypeBeast
I think Supreme suck, we gnarly in our Nikes
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fucking White T
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag
In fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain
With a four finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name
And I go to Obama rallies screaming out "McCain"
Them ignorant thrashing mothafuckers is my gang
And the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from
Nigga, you don't claim none, fun I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a mothafucking zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter


[Hook]
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
My nigga, no hook
No hook, fuck a hook


[Bridge]
(It's gold) The gold is in the back
(It's gold) The pixels in the front
(It's gold) The beat's a fucking bully
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man
(Gold) The pink is in the sky
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold
The beat is turning old, so go (yo)


[Verse 3]
Synthesizer, I'm the mothafucking master
Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys
Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song
Than a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic
Nigga, you can bite this, unless you want to bite back
I didn't take my fucking Ritalin, this is a hype track
HypeTrak that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit
I had you motherfuckers eating salad like a fat bitch


[Outro]
Drop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.M, banging on your FM
Ace the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to HypeBeast






[Intro: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
So, do you party?
Nah, I just do ignorant hoodrat shit with me and my niggas in the fucking mall, Odd Future Wolf Gang
(Drop it)


[Verse 1: Jasper Dolphin]
Niggas at the fucking mall, niggas, where my fucking drawers?
Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch, you fucking know my dad
He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick
You's a fag, you like that shit, OF is the fucking clique
I'm going off the top of the brain
Nigga, don't know how to rap, but I'm in the game
Fuck that shit, I'on't give a fuck
I'm back up in the fucking club, niggas know I'm at the mall
Eating chips with my drawers, how you doin'? How you fall?


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with All]
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Eat my ass, lick my balls
Bitch, I'm in the fucking mall, with my niggas, eating ham (Mmm) (Yo)
Bitch, I got that fucking swag, you don't know my fucking dad
I don't know my fucking dad, what is this? A fucking purse?
I ain't fucking Mexican, but we can have sex again
With your sister, with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex)
What the fuck? That's your fucking brother?
I ain't with that jerkin' shit
Unless, it's Steve Harvey's buff sister trying to jerk my dick


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with All]
Swag, swag, swag, swag (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave


[Bridge]
All: Swag, swag, swag
Taco: Swag, SWAG, SWAG, SWAG
Tyler, the Creator: Oh no, oh no, oh no
Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag


[Verse 3: Travis Taco]
I'm with your girlfriend, eating chips
Mmm, stop the beat, bitch
Uh, oh, oh, shit, fuck, mmm, mmm
Wait, stop the beat
Alright, yeah, nigga, I was in the mall
With my niggas, busting triggers, yee, swag


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with All]
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave
Tina, perm your fucking weave


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitches, hoes, weaves, leather jackets (Nigga don't know)
Bitches, weaves, hoes, leather jackets
Bitches, weaves, hoes, swag (I'ma kill you and that fucking baby, bitch)






[Intro: Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, uh
It's about that time
I mean, you're a good kid, just misguided
Okay, so is there anything else you wanna say before we end this?


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My father died the day I came out of my mother's hole
And left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he... (Shake Junt)
Bring Your Pops to School Day, for twelve years, I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring That Dude to Life day, he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the way there like, "The fuck am I thinking?" (What?)
Birthdays, Christmas, my only fucking wishlist
Was CDs (And a father) and a new fit
Instead, I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper 'cause I ain't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit (Nigga!)
Well I guess I had one, 'cause, nigga, I'm it
You smell that? (Yeah!) That's the odor of success, bitch


[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
I know I'm not the only bastard
In America
So I'm gon' to need some help, on this next part
Scream it with me, niggas


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator & Tyler, the Creator & Hodgy Beats]
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Fuck you) I graduated
(Without you) I'm good
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Nigga, eighteen) I'm good
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Got a car, nigga) Fuck you
(Eat a dick, nigga) Bitch


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts
'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
Now, my mama mentioned the day before what she would like
'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fucking right
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon (Nope)
I look up to the Hugos and Dixons (Yup)
The niggas in the vision, rap about the shit they cooking in the kitchen
Pushing keys, like them niggas that were banging on them keys
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me a hoodie, a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up for the years and the tears
And the money that my mama spent on rent and clothes
You fucking dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you I'ma get out
The M-16 and let a fucking clip out (RAH!)
'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none
I don't give a fuck either, like father, like son, I'm done


[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
He ain't give a fuck about me
He ain't give a fuck about you
He ain't give a fuck about we
So what the fuck we gon' do?


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator & Tyler, the Creator & Hodgy Beats]
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Fuck you) I graduated
(Without you) I'm good
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Nigga, eighteen) I'm good
(Fuck you) I'm good
(Got a car, nigga) Fuck you
(Eat a dick, nigga) Bitch


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
The cold is nice, and I'm not talking 'bout the weather
The skin is thick, no need for leather
Your father called, he said you're better without him
I'm not the only fuck without them
How to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed
Up, take it to the shop, then, what?
Fuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck
Luck on my brim, Sup-preme keeps me warm
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frío
Now, this counselor is tryna tell me that I'm emo
She don't give a fuck
D-low, where's the trigger? I'll let this bullet play hero


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Shit
No, no, fuck that
Fuck that
I ain't deserve this
I'm over it
BANG!






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucki—OH, SHIT!
Floopy goober, motherfucker (Floopy fuckin' goober)
Hey man god damn, hey bro
They ain't ready for what we 'bout to bring back!
They ain't ready for Tyler with the green hat!
Ugh, fuck it
They ain't ready for the Wang$ap, niggas!
I—I'ma rap this next verse
Fuck is niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Yo
We gon' die legends!


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
I hope you stackin'
I hope you puttin' some money to the side, my nigga
And payin' your taxes (Yeah)
I hope you not incriminatin' you and your niggas
On songs if you trappin'
I hope you dressin' yourself
And not followin' niggas opinions on fashion
I hope them cars that you drivin' ain't rented
Just to get some comments on 'Gram
Oh, shit, they are, because you not the man
Low self-esteem, hide it in lean (Yeah)
Xan every meal
You fuckin' weak, and you robbin' your plug? (Yeah)
You ain't got no plan, but I'm not here to judge
'Cause apparently you're doin' your thing
Talk your shit, Young Nigga! Woo!
I know they see me
Your pants got a flood, a little bit Katrina
Oh you wearin' Vans and Supreme this season?
Stop lyin' to yourself, nigga, me the reason
AHH! Right now, nigga
Ugh, right now
A little gooey with some nice sounds huh
This little groupie want the pipe now yeah
She eatin' coochie, kinda dyke now, ugh
Got a new dirt bike, wow
And it match the go-kart, go skrrt! now (Talk your shit!)
I really want the La Ferrar', but shit (Vmmm)
Can't you lower the price down?


[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Tyler The Creator]
Fuck right now
Ayy! Ayy!
Fuck right now
Woo! God! Ayy
Ayy right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Go right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Bite down, nigga, here we go!


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
'Cause I'm not one (Woo!)
When it come to a vision, they ain't got one (Woo!)
Rolling Stone never gave me a cover, so...
Um... (god) So I shot one! (Woo!)
I ain't do college (Woo!), I said fuck them lessons (Yeah)
I ain't join no gang, I said fuck them weapons (Yeah)
Grabbed the keyboard, Clancy crossed my path (Woo!)
Cashed my first check and said "Fuck depression, nigga!"
(Got this money!)
Nigga what you scared for? (Woo!)
Everybody lean, everybody gang though (right)
Nigga you a new slave, I'm an old one
Thanks to Ben Yang, still walk around with chains on (Right)
Like you ain't seen no shit like mine (Woo!)
You ain't seen no dick like mine
Nah, pause
Waddup


[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
What the, what the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? (Right now!)
What the fuck right now? (Golf Wang, nigga!)
What the fuck right now? (A$AP Gang, nigga!)
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? (Ay ay ay ay)
What the fuck right now?
(These niggas don't know what we 'bout to do)
What the fuck right now? (Ay man)
(These niggas don't even understand! Goddamn, man!)


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Told you dickheads I'ma go nuts (Woo)
Niggas told me to grow up (Hanh?!)
So I matured to a V10 (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in a vacant lot doin' donuts (Skrrt, skrrt)
There go my ego, Leggo my Eggo
Never sip syrup, shout my nigga Scooty
Y'all don't want beef, let us know he can eat that bread
Cause he pushin' that mayo, fuego (Oww!)
Respect when you see him
Boy, last album was a musical museum
Somethin' always lost with you niggas like Liam
Neeson, boy, you better run (Yeah!)
Here I come, snortin' glitter, portrait pictures
I don't run with many cause their walk is bitter
Niggas mad at T, where the tall freckled white boys at?
'Cause I don't fuck with niggas (Woo!)
That's not my homie, that's not my whoadies (Yeah!)
That not my team, nigga, they're benchwarmers (Fuck 'em!)
I am a stormer, I am a trooper (fuck'em!)
I am a Koopa, bet it lost its value as soon as I moved it
I run the business, I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're deadweight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news (Woo!)
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump-jacks (Riiight)
My big bro Frankie got a Porsche (Hanh?)
My little brother Taco got a Bimmer
If you see 'em around me, they eatin'
We all good, it's like FEMA, but of course


[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Get money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny lookin' niggas, back the fuck up!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, man


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Um, oh, I wanted to add this
I sit in room with a to-do list, pro-
Ceed to do and play acoustics, you
Sit around and look at me feelin' foolish
Rollin' up and make excuses, fucking losers
Jesus, damn man


[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck them niggas! Ayy man, ayy man!
What the fuck right now!
Ayy I just got one mothafuckin' question
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas wanna look like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these hoes wanna fuck a nigga like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas frontin' like niggas ain't been invented the swag they runnin' with?
Why the fuck is niggas actin' like niggas ain't the originators of this shit?
Man, I tell these niggas they can die and suck a dick!
How was that?
Cool?

Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurking, bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again, I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy, bitch, don't look at my wrist (At my wrist)
Because if you do (If you do), I might blind you bitch (Bitch)
Mount Everest ain't fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this the Ice Age, bitch (Bitch suck dick)


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin, Tyler, the Creator, Jasper Dolphin]
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch

Yo, yo, Jasper, Taco, y'all my niggas, man
I love y'all niggas, I'm sorry
[Gunshot]
Ow! What the fuck?!






[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding


[Hook]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high


[Verse 2]
Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
But they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back


[Hook]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high


[Bridge]
What's in my trunk? White, girl
What's in my trunk? White, girl
You need a warrant, officer


[Outro]
You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven
Drums






[Intro]
Oh, my nigga, oh shit, cuz it's startin', aaaaight!


[Verse 1]
Wolf Gang be on that wrist split splatter
Snortin' coke pattern misfit'll hit Mick Jagger
Me and Jasper bangin' Bastard, beatin' midgets up with ladders nigga
Don't give a fuck, that's that Wolf Gang swagger
Don't give a shit so my dick fuck bladders in your ear
Radical shows that Wolf Gang's radder
With a staggerin' pack of cocaine in the sack of my dick
Where the lips of your teen daughter sits, bitch
Fuck Tyler, I'mma change my name to Uncle Phil
Cause every girl I deal and fuck, it's always against her Will
Dope enough to snort crack and sit the fuck still
In Nellyville's old folks home searchin' tip drills
Get my fill on with this grandmother named Jill
Takin' shots of poon juice to the head for a cheap thrill
Hopefully my dick don't shrivel up, when it's time to bust
In this rusty cunt, that won a cup in collectin' dust
Boogyin' with Jesus and a bunch of Nazi hoes
In the front row at a holy Justin Bieber show
Slowly my Ritalin is kickin' in and Jesus left hand
Begin to make me feel like a little kid again
This isn't rape, this is fuckin' without a condom on
Throw her slightly to the right, so dyke I'm kinda wrong
Wolves is out past dawn on your front lawn
Me and Juan ensurin' you that your slut daughter's gone
At the pawn shop, tryna sell this Baume watch
She's a white vegetarian, I'll get this blonde cock
Lip balm she's some nun bitch from St. John
Told her that her pastor was a faggot and he likes John
He's a janitor recreational rectum manager
I am not, let's consider me a little pecan
That'll get your chest nutted on with an acorn
They swore that I was all fuckin' nuts like a gay porn
Cause I disregard the white dress and the perm weave
And the headrest had to have about eight thorns
I was born back, Wolf pack, nigga fuck that
Somebody tell Satan that I want my fuckin' swag back


[Chorus]
Niggas know it's Wolf Gang, in the mall with
Thirty bitches, and they gorgeous
Wolf Gang, killing niggas, rabble rousers
And Wolf Gang running shit in dirty houses
Wolf Gang (Kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang (We gotta kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang (Kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang, you better kill 'em


[Verse 2]
Box logo on my muthafuckin' chest
Left hand staggerin' on her muthafuckin' breast
Deep down, I'm an emo fuckin' faggot that's depressed
So the fuckin' school suggested me a therapist
I confessed bein' atheist, they said I was possessed
By a demon, cause I wanna see a bitch infested
With my semen and oppressed by my give a fuck less
Of the baby not bein' digested by a fuckin' hungry punk
Feedin' kids to slutty nuns with his cum
Got a fuckin' blog that needs a post? I can get it done
2DopeBoyz I know you like this
(Like what?) This hot cum that's from my dick
Call me a clown but a week from now
You're goin' to hear this and begin to ride on my dick
Like how the fuck did we miss this kid's shit
Oh yeah we're old as fuck, we didn't have our glasses
But fuck y'all, I don't need y'all help
I got 20 thousand views of French itself
And I did the video for really though
You silly rabbit faggot tricks are for kids so we go, Abracadabra






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, now you gon' start me from the top? Listen
Shout out Harlem, man
Shout out A$AP Rocky, man
AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs
I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses
Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris


[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers
In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahaha, yeah!


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
K shiz, what up, nigga!






[Intro]
It's 9:23 A.M
And uh.. an idea
Summer feeling idea
Yeah, I don't know


[Chorus]
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)


[Verse]
Yeah, mama, yeah, mama, I'm daddy, no, I'm not
You're a lot of fucking problems, you gon’ prolly show true colors
By the time we tie the knot up, Tyler, Tyler, he got caught up
Now they taking my ricotta, bunch of lawyers and ‘your honors’
I mean, no mama, more father but my fanbase that's from Goblin
Don't believe me, I been saying since '13 but they blinded
But whatever, I'm reminded that I slightly got off topic of this song, shit
Shout out Prophet, okay
Could you tell me how far in the future do you see us?
You can make decisions while your lips graze on my peach fuzz
Pull out the guitar and learn some new chords from Anita Baker
Baker got some acres out the window when you wake up
I'm a fish sign, my b-day March and put it's knee up
Bunch of yes sergeants 'til we barge in on them tea cups
But guarantee that I will get my stripes just like Adidas
Nah, we don't wear those, it's UNOs when we put feet up, yeah


[Chorus]
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)


[Outro]
Yo, shout out Stones Throw man
Shout out Prophet
Album's beautiful
Summer flings and shit
It's nothing serious, just, you know






[Intro]
Try to do this bitch in one take, or somethin'...


[Verse]
What's the point of bein' rich when you wake up alone?
What's the point of goin' home when it ain't nobody there?
Fuck that, I grab my bike and phone home in the air
And I pedal through the city with the wide frame steer
With that tall pale boy that I met last year
Grape, that's what I call him, love, that's what I fall in
Fell in, I ain't like sports growing up, but now I'm ballin'
I guess I'm a late bloomer
Ayo, look, high tide bottoms 'cause the neck on lunar
Them GOLF le FLEUR unos 'cause, we don't do Puma, nah
20k pairs, gone in 3 seconds
You ain't gotta like him and you ain't gotta respect him
For playin' chess with these niggas
That think that they're bench pressin'
Leg day is getting skipped, guess who really runnin' shit?
Young Teezy, it ain't easy, feelin' wheezy in this bitch
New slaves got y'all niggas feelin' breezy on the ship
Pour a Fanta in your poison so its easier to sip, huh?
Haha!
My shit leaked two weeks before that release date
First week, did dos, a thousand off, beat Meek
Shout out Meek! Two niggas first week top 3!
And I can't even get a song to play on the radio
But tripled in them ratings, TV channels still pay me tho, haha
P told me not to trip
I am in my Ziploc, nigga
Feel like I got the best album out, uh
I know I got the best album out, preach


[Outro]
Let me, let me hear that






[Intro]
Yuh, ayo
Ayo


[Verse]
I put the feline in my hair, looking like a cheetah pet
And you know they getting green if a flower on they neck
If a flower on they neck hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gassin' niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passionfruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the Gramm's, one nom ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again, yuh
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy
Getting to the paper better re-up on the chalkboard
Because the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'm a god nigga ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yuh
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tired like a long day
Big dollars, the scent Prada
Skinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me
If you see me out in public, no pictures don't record me
I don't really fuck with y'all nigga, selfish at the orgy, uh


[Outro]
Bitch
One take
Yuh






[Intro]
Man, now they go (ayo)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Did this shit in one take, ayo)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Ayy, we got that fire shit, nigga)
Fuck these niggas man (run it)


[Verse 1]
Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him


[Chorus]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure


[Verse 2]
Say
Uno the shoe, red with the blue
Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 (hey!)
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you


[Chorus]
Man, now they go
(I ain't fuckin' with none of these niggas, man)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Yeah, give these niggas information nigga)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Now we never fuckin' stop)
Fuck these (ayo) niggas man, that's for sure (ayo)


[Verse 3]
Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you’re a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra


[Outro]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends






[Intro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
Beep


[Verse 1]
I never had the courage to tell you I adore you
I did it in a song, I was too afraid to call you
I know, I know, I'm sorry, I know I'm annoyin'
I just want your attention
Ever since I saw you, knew nothin' was important
Your gravity is too strong and it's fuckin' up my orbit
Contact avoided by the time I record this
I just want you to listen


[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay
No, I won't...


[Chorus]
'Cause it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)


[Verse 2]
They Black Flag we AF
We BF as AF
But they won't get that
That's that 20 Century Women reference
You so hard to get like intricate metaphors
Companies? I own four
But all I want is yours
Hit the 'plex and catch a band (ooh)
Sushi spot I recommend (ooh)
Float around hittin' wheelies, leg or engine-based, it all depends
Either one is cool to me
And you're way too cool for me
I'ma freeze to death tryna keep up
Thirsty I am, I may need three cups, what's up?


[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay


[Chorus]
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks, uh


[Verse 3]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact, yeah
Speedin' down the 5 in my newest ride
You was kinda high, speakers mild high
Track 10 track 10, dirt bike afternoons
As long as pale skin's near, I didn't have to leave the room
Switch gears
Roamed around fell in love (fell in love)
Broke my leg, got stuck, what the fuck?
Hit my head, wait, I wish you would fall in too, I said
I wish you would fall in and snap them legs
Cause I'ma be stuck here until I'm dead and gone


[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, uh
La-la-la, la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la


[Outro]
I remember when we first met
My eyes, like jeans too tight, I couldn't take 'em off you
You're precious metal I was a magnet just lookin'
I've been searching for somethin'
But didn't know what I was looking for
Then you popped and it became so clear
Like that water up north, so clear
Got me sayin'
Alright, alright
And truthfully now
I'm intimidated by your existence
Flustered because of your presence and
Your absence leaves me, leaves me in a state of confusion... I mean... (uh huh, alright)
I really can't function (ahhh)
La-la-la-la (uh-huh)
I can't explain it (uh-huh)
I'm aware enough to know this is just a temporary pool of emotion, shit (uh-huh, alright)
But since I'm here, I might as well drown, so
Please don't save me (uh-huh)
Ha ha ha, woo!
Yeah, alright (uh huh, alright)

It don't matter, negative niggas gon' say, this don't add up
But fuck they math up, shit, we subtract 'em
Ayo, tell me what's the prolo, I just pop models
Boys or girls these days, shit, it don't matter
We can fuck Sunday 'cause I don't read Bibles
But I'm faithful to this money and these Céline goggles
I don't pop bottles, I just cop automobiles full throttle
New engine can't follow, get a jet to Lake Como
We can try some new gelato, shawty, I'm for real
Like my role model, hm
So let's—
Shawty, I listen
Unlike my father, I can give you attention (Ayy!)
You won't feel empty like pocket that lint in
So pack a few bags I got space in my mansions (Plural)
Hurry with decision
'Cause I'm looking for a parrot and you looking like a pigeon
Better That's So Raven and get another vision
If you wanna be my newest edition like Bivins, woah


[Chorus: Jaquees]
Feel like you need some validation (Yeah, yeah)
I got a plan 'cause you're more than that
No better situation, girl
No, no, girl you all for that, and I 'magine that
Feel like you need some validation
While I'm grippin' your waist, we move to your pace
No better situation (come on)
Girl, I'll be your escape, come and swing my way
You think niggas full of lies

Nigga dick ride 'til your neck hurt
Nigga we ok, boy better know BBK
You want war then I'm G.I. Joe

Then skate off like a T.I. role (I say we get outta here)
Niggas pretend to be bosses
You signed a 360, you lost it
That's 400 for my exhaust, the mean with the walk
Now tell the Black Youth, to just be
Tell 'em never stop
Yeah we all moving, but you ain't gotta put us in a box
We can paint, we can draw, whatever

Whatever movie setting you choose

Two cribs, I can sleep twice (twice)
Niggas swear they woke but got crust in their eyes
They can't blink right (woo!)
These niggas fake confidence and fake show how they feel
Then go home and big cry because that acne is real
Show them scars motherfucker
How you think they gon' heal up?
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me, I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them, it ain't no hate in my heart
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas

I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs

Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters


[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]

Stepping in puddles in them new (Giannos, nigga, come on)

You a G? No, you're not
New balloon, watch it p-
Concave on a skateboard
Don't do surfboards, I don't ride waves
Been around forever, Murray's Pomade, nigga
Been like a decade, yeah, haha, uh, ayy, yo


[Verse 2]
Keep it buck, I switch it up
You niggas don't, that's why you stuck
I needed seven figures, hit Australia, pick it up
Find some young twink and get my nipples sucked
Bad yellow bitch look like pimple pus
Bad chocolate bitch look like Lionel knuckles
Y'all got too much baggage and I pack light, Louis trunk
Luggage double C, emeralds double V
Uni tee, but the sweater vest is me
Lemonade, elderflower with the rose
Sony re'd up, I'ma split it with the bro, yeah
Yeah


[Verse 3]
Niggas like, "Act your age, T, you trippin'"
Pushin' thirty, but the skin say different, well
If I act my last deal, I'm probably twelve
I put some niggas on, nigga set a lob
Then they hurt theyself, niggas Cheddar Bob (Pew, pew, pew)
Foot is on the gas, I ain't letting off (Skrrt)
Every car is gas, pissing Greta off
And they Group B and the leather soft
And I knew the cow, and he better off dead

One take
It's like 7 a.m., haha






[Verse 1]
Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It’s just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my brain, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (You don’t have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side bettor
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side bettor
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up, give it up, give it up


[Chorus]
I’ll keep your, your best interest
I’ll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your best interest
I’ll keep your best interest


[Verse 2]
I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I’m the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures (Click-click-click-click)
(I won't tell anybody, it's our secret)
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is seesaw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I would never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I'll carry the weight 'til my hands sore
(We can't keep doing this)


[Chorus]
I'll keep your, your best interest (It's our secret)
I'll keep your best interest
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)

I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high

Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
(My love is gone)
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
(My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)
[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when "Yonkers" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up, but I keep short like Caesar

My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga

It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)

"You need to say somethin' 'bout black—"
Bitch, suck my—
Yeah

That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby
[Verse 2: Domo Genesis & DJ Drama]
Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tapped in the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig? (Ching)

Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the molotov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a "What the fuck now?"
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)

I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

If you fuck with my kids, I'll beat up kids over my kid, okay?
This little boy used to run, he was scared
I said, "Go get your bitch-ass mama"
I would beat your whole family and didn't give a fuck
They be like, "Tyler, Tyler mama crazy, Tyler mama crazy"
Yup, don't fuck with my kids
Tyler would be like "Get 'em, mom"
But she like "No, don't do it"

Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes," I'm like, "Mm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh

It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, "No, no, it's not a end," ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha," we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that," ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, "No, you pick a place"
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days with me, your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost," your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book26Embed SAFARI Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama & Tyler, The Creator]

We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, "Au revoir," to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like "Who?" I'm like, "Oui," ha

They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when "Yonkers" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up, but I keep short like Caesar
Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh

[Break: DJ Drama]
Seein' that we only get one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break
[Outro: DJ Drama]

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, "Fuck 'em"
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga

It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)

That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch

Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)

What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)

Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em

I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?

There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point

So what's mine is yours (Woo, woo, woo)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Uzi Vert]
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit
Last deal more than what Google say my net is
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit (Like woah)
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, woah

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
It's the double P, I rock double C
Man, I run them beats like you run in cleats
Man, come to me, you want somethin' to see
This internally flawed, that's a double Vs
What troubles me is you couple me
With these subtle fleas tryna double league
Hornet trapped in the hive of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it, it's clickbait
And that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck wheels, deck, grip tape
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit (Why you even talkin' to us?)
Last deal more than what Google say my net is (Goddamn)
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit (Like woah)
Uh, uh, uh (Bitch)67Embed WILSHIRE Lyrics[Intro]
Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes," I'm like, "Mm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh
[Interlude]
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, "No, no, it's not a end," ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha," we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that," ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, "No, you pick a place"
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days with me, your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost," your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book26Embed SAFARI Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama & Tyler, The Creator]
Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, "Au revoir," to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like "Who?" I'm like, "Oui," ha

We on a safari
Legendary (Safari)
World-renowned
Globally recognized
Catch us if you can (Baby, we on a safari)
Are you keepin' up? ('Fari)
Once in a lifetime (Baby, we on a safari)
This what it sounds like when the moon and the sun collide
Speakin' matter-of-factly (Baby, we on a safari)
We're just light years ahead (You said that it was you I saw with another in my place)

Every car retarded, the garage look like a loony bin
What coupe he in? Depends on the 'fit and the type of mood he in (Ugh)
I been switchin' gears since Tracee Ellis Ross was UPN
Clutch, then he stroke outta nowhere like a droopy grin (Ugh)
Huh, took that Grammy home, couldn't lose again
The suit was so sharp that it could get Medusa coochie trimmed (Ugh)
Hov talkin' 'bout a hundred million, nigga, loop me in
Like who that young, rich, handsome nigga with the gooey skin? (Ugh)
Mama named him Tyler and his brothers call him T
And the bank, they call him when that wire clear like season three or somethin' (Ugh)
Skateboard named him Bunnyhop, it's Baudelaire or Wolfie, though
The felines named him hour for how long he eat the— (Pussy) wait a minute (Ugh)
Pink loafers scuff quickly, Fiat cost a buck sixty
I'll keep it a buck fifty, y'all can't really fuck with me (Ugh)
Bitch, I got the fuzz and I'ma own it 'til they bury him
Only twenty-nine, but I've been focused since thirty M (Ugh)
